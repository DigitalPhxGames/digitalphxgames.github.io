## Our First Update

Welcome to the official **Digital Phoenix Dev Blog**!

We’ll be using this space to share behind-the-scenes updates, progress on our current project *OSIRIS*, and insights into our development process.

We believe in keeping players informed, so you’ll find early concepts, technical breakdowns, and even some fun experiments here.

Stay tuned - more updates coming soon!
